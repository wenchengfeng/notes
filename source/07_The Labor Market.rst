Ch7 The Labor Market
====================

Tour of the Labor Market
------------------------

-  We have focused on the short run by assuming a constant price level
   in the IS-LM model.

-  We now turn to the medium run and explore how prices and wages adjust
   over time, and how this in turn affects output.

-  | The labor market is the center of that sequence of events. 

-  解决全社会范围的大规模失业是宏观经济学的目标之一。就业是任何一个负责任的政府最关注的统计指标之一。

劳动力市场统计
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Out of the total **population**, we can define **non-institutional
   civilian population** as those who are 16 or above (not inmates of
   institutions and not in the Armed Forces), and are either employed or
   unemployed

-  16周岁以上成年人口(不含囚犯、军人): 就业、失业、非劳动力人口

-  Part of the non-institutional population that is either working or
   looking forwork is the **labor force** 劳动力

-  劳动力参与率 labor force participation rate：成年人口中劳动力的百分比

-  :math:`Labor~force~participation~rate=\frac{labor force}{non-institutional~population}`

-  失业率unemployment rate：劳动力中没有被雇佣的比率

-  \:math:`Unemployment~ rate =\frac{ unemployed}{labor~force}`\

-  The unemployment rate is the ratio of the unemployed to the labor
   force, was 9.5/155.9 = 6.1\\%.

我国的劳动力市场统计

中国的人口和劳动力, 2015年数据

-  人口 13.7462 亿

-  经济活动人口(劳动力) 8.0091 亿

   -  (16周岁及以上，有劳动能力，参加或要求参加社会经济活动的人口。包括就业人员和失业人员。)

-  就业人员 7.7451 亿

-  城镇人口 7.7116 亿

-  城镇就业人员 4.0410 亿

-  城镇登记失业人员 966 万

-  城镇登记失业率 4.1\\%

   -  登记失业率：需要去当地社保局登记。

   -  调查失业率：以居民调查为主，从2014年开始公布

Unemployment rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  A given unemployment rate may reflect either:

-  An active labor market: Many \\textbf{separations} and hires, i.e,
   many workers entering and exiting unemployment

-  A sclerotic labor market: Few separations and hires, and a stagnant
   unemployment pool

-  The Current Population Survey (CPS) shows the average monthly flows.

-  Separations include quits and layoffs.

-  The average duration of unemployment—the length of time people spend
   unemployed—is 2 to 3 months.

(1) The flows of workers in and out of employment are large. (2) The
flows in and out of unemployment are large relative to the number of
unemployed. (3) There are also large flows in and out of the labor
force, much of it directly to and from employment. \\end{itemize}

.. code:: 

    \begin{itemize}
    	Many who are classified as “out of the labor force” are in fact discouraged workers—not actively looking for a job but will take it if they find one.
      So, rather than the unemployment rate, economists sometimes focus on the employment rate—the ratio of employment to the population.

.. code:: 

      When unemployment is high, workers are worse off in two ways:
      Employed workers face a higher probability of losing their job.
      Unemployed workers face a lower probability of finding a job; or they can expect to remain unemployed for a longer time.

      Two things are missing in our model so far
      We have not dealt with the labor market at all: we do not know if there are people unemployed at the equilibrium income level
      Also, the price level is “fixed” in our model
      We have not explained how it is determined
      Hence the Blanchard calls the IS-LM model a short-run model
      We now move toward the medium run, at which price level and

employment are determined

.. code:: 

      You consider the medium run when it is no longer appropriate to assume a

constant price
