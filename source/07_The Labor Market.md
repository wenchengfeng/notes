# 第七章 劳动力市场

- We have focused on the short run by assuming a constant price level in the IS-LM model.
- We now turn to the medium run and explore how prices and wages adjust over time, and how this in turn affects output.
- The labor market is the center of that sequence of events.   
- 解决全社会范围的大规模失业是宏观经济学的目标之一。就业是任何一个负责任的政府最关注的统计指标之一。

## 劳动力市场统计

- Out of the total **population**, we can define **non-institutional civilian population** as those who are 16 or above (not inmates of institutions and not in the Armed Forces), and are either employed or unemployed
- 16周岁以上成年人口(不含囚犯、军人): 就业、失业、非劳动力人口
- Part of the non-institutional population that is either working or looking forwork is the **labor force** 劳动力
- 劳动力参与率 labor force participation rate：成年人口中劳动力的百分比


- $$Labor~force~participation~rate=\frac{labor force}{non-institutional~population}$$

- 失业率unemployment rate：劳动力中没有被雇佣的比率
- $$Unemployment~ rate =\frac{ unemployed}{labor~force}$$

- The unemployment rate is the ratio of the unemployed to the labor force, was 9.5/155.9 = 6.1\%.

## Unemployment rate



- 
  A given unemployment rate may reflect either:

- An active labor market: Many \textbf{separations} and hires, i.e, many workers entering and exiting unemployment
- A sclerotic labor market: Few separations and hires, and a stagnant unemployment pool
- The Current Population Survey (CPS) shows the average monthly flows.
- Separations include quits and layoffs.
- The average duration of unemployment—the length of time people spend unemployed—is 2 to 3 months.
- ​

-  (1) The flows of workers in and out of employment are large. 


-   (2) The flows in and out of unemployment are large relative to the number of unemployed. 
-   (3) There are also large flows in and out of the labor force, much of it directly to and from employment.

### Out of the labor force

- Many who are classified as “out of the labor force” are in fact discouraged workers—not actively looking for a job but will take it if they find one.
-   So, rather than the unemployment rate, economists sometimes focus on the employment rate—the ratio of employment to the population.

## Movements in Unemployment}

### 中国的失业率变化

 \caption{中国的失业率变化}

- When unemployment is high, workers are worse off in two ways:
  - Employed workers face a higher probability of losing their job.
  - Unemployed workers face a lower probability of finding a job; or they can expect to remain unemployed for a longer time.
- Two things are missing in our model so far
- We have not dealt with the labor market at all: we do not know if there are people unemployed at the equilibrium income level
- Also, the price level is “fixed” in our model
-  We have not explained how it is determined
- Hence the Blanchard calls the IS-LM model a short-run model
- We now move toward the medium run, at which price level and employment are determined

      You consider the medium run when it is no longer appropriate to assume a
constant price
